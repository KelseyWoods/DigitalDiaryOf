  <h1>WELCOME TO THE DIGITAL DREAMGIRL DIARY</h1>
  <p>
    This is an online archive sharing real stories from women, non-binary and femme-identifying people about their experiences with Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence (TFGBV).
  </p>
  <p>
    Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence (TFGBV) is defined as any form of gendered abuse carried out, amplified, or enabled through digital technology. When published on the 25th June, 2025, 90% of individuals who completed this survey experienced some form of gender-based harassment through digital technology. Research shows TFGBV is a predecessor to physical abuse.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project raises awareness of how digital spaces, algorithmic bias, and the manosphere shape gendered harm, dealing real life consequences.
  </p>
  <p>
    This website is a digital community to speak out, be heard, and observe how tech-driven violence is evolving alongside social media and AI.
  </p>
  <p>
    The archive is ongoing and open for contributions via the link below. All submissions are anonymous and screened for hate speech, discrimination and threats before publication.
