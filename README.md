# Digital Diary Of: An Archive of Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence (TFGBV)

This is a living, digital archive dedicated to documenting the real and often invisible experiences of women and femme-identifying individuals who have faced **Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence (TFGBV)**. These stories explore the deep emotional, psychological, and physical impacts of harm that begins in digital spaces but echoes far beyond them.

## 📖 What is TFGBV?

Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence includes any form of gendered harm that is carried out, enabled, or amplified through digital technologies. This can include:
- Online harassment
- Image-based abuse
- Doxxing
- Deepfake pornography
- Non-consensual sharing of images
- Stalking and threats via digital platforms

Research shows that digital violence is often a **precursor to physical violence**, used to intimidate, isolate, and silence. The project also explores how **online misogynist communities (the manosphere)** influence the behaviour and beliefs of young men, and how algorithmic systems contribute to the normalization of abuse.
